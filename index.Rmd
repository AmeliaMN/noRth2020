Hi, I'm Amelia McNamara. I'm an assistant professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. I tweet at AmeliaMN, which is a double entendre because my last name is McNamara and I live in Minnesota. I just tweeted a link to these slides if you want to follow along.

Let's say I wanted to know the bill lengths of all the `palmerpenguins` in inches. There are many approaches I could take.

If I was coming from a programming language other than R, my first impulse might be to use a **for loop**, which turns out to be very **inefficient** in R.

Instead, I should take a **vectorized approach**. I don't actually need to iterate over every element. 
```{r}
penguins$bill_length_in <- penguins$bill_length_mm / 25.4

???

As you may already know, traditional control structures like for-loops can be very inefficient in R. Vectorized operations avoid the copy-on-modify issue, and are overall less work for you as the programmer!

I grabbed this example from my recent useR! talk. We can avoid copying and pasting by using an apply() function, but I can never remember the syntax.

I'd like to talk to you about two scraping projects I've done recently. 

---
# Counting commits 

The first project relates to a promise I made my students in Spring 2019. GitHub had sent me some swag to distribute to students, including two t-shirt redemption codes. 

> I'll give a t-shirt to the student with the most commits over the semester in each section.

class: big-bullet
## One approach (that I didn't use)

- For each student, use the GitHub API to determine all repositories they committed to
- For each repository, use the API to determine the number of commits in that repository
- Total all commits for each student by adding up commits from each repository they committed to

## Issues

- Seemed like a lot of levels of iteration to deal with
- If a student committed to an active repo, their count would be artificially inflated
- Students worked in groups on repos

## So... what did I do?

Scraping! 

Initially, I was just going to grab that number where it says "411 contributions in the last year."

Take a session, then jump to a url, then read the HTML, then select the HTML nodes that match that selector (selector gadget!), then extract the text, then take the second element and parse the number. 

This is a function that finds that number. 

---
# Aside-- selectorgadget
```{r, eval=FALSE}
commits <- function(url, session) {
  session %>%
    jump_to(url) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes("h2.f4.text-normal.mb-2") %>% #<<
    html_text() %>%
    purrr::pluck(2) %>%
    readr::parse_number()
}
```

It's really hard to figure out those selectors. One helpful tool is [selectorgadget](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html), "a JavaScript bookmarklet that allows you to interactively figure out what css selector you need to extract desired components from a page."

# Iterating over URLs

```{r firstmap, eval=FALSE}
library(purrr)
roster %>% 
  mutate(commits = map_dbl(url, commits, session = session)) %>% #<< 
  arrange(desc(commits))
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
  <<firstmap>>
```
]

.pull-right[
`map_dbl()` is one of the map functions from the `purrr` package. It returns a vector of type double, so it needs to be inside a `mutate()` command. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/purrr.png")

# Problems

1. I didn't say I was giving the t-shirt to the person with the most commits in the last year, I said in the time period of the semester
2. Many of my students' commits were on private GitHub repos (visible to me, because of how they were set up in GitHub classroom)

# Let's solve problem 1

## An aside-- you can make your private contributions show up in the graph
![](img/GitHubPreferences.png)

???
This is just an aside, but I believe the default is to have private contributions not counted on your profile. I've changed this preference myself, because I want more of those green boxes! 

My students hadn't done this, so I needed to be logged in to see their "true" commit counts.

---

![](img/GitHubProfileGreenBlocks.png)

Instead, I decided to grab those green blocks, which actually have data attached to them!

Check it out! They have the dates and number of commits.

# Here we go again

```{r anothermap}
commits_by_date <- function(url, session){
  session %>%
    jump_to(url) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes("rect.day") %>%
    html_attrs() %>%
    map_dfr(as.list) %>% #<<
    select(count = `data-count`, date = `data-date`) %>% 
    mutate(
      date = parse_date(date),
      count = parse_number(count),
      )

This gets the data from the green boxes. Again, refactored by Charlotte.

Earlier, I was showing you the code that Charlotte helped me refactor. This was what I actually used when I needed to figure out who won the t-shirt. This code is uuuugly. And slow. 

Perfect code doesn't flow out of my (or any programmer's) fingers. If you don't succeed, try try again.

# Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of turning working but ugly or inefficient code into better, faster, cleaner code. You can do it yourself or you can have a peer do it. 

> So what do I do when I face code I don’t get? I change it, that’s all, until I get it. But here’s the entry point to this muse: change it how!?? I don’t understand it. I can’t just jump in anywhere and start changing shit.

> The trick is to narrow your focus until you find a line or two that on the one hand, you can understand, but on the other hand, takes you a reading or two to get. In other words, tho graspable, it’s not readily so. Then you fix it. Then you try again.

> As I continue to work this way, find a tiny thing, fix it, find a tiny thing, fix it, two things occur, one straightforward and one remarkable.

> The straightforward thing that occurs is that I gradually gain some modest understanding as I work. 

> And the remarkable thing? The search for "easiest nearest owwie" starts returning different results.

# Facebook

In October 2019, I finally deleted my Facebook account. I had been a user since I got a college email address in 2006, and had looked at it multiple times a day, every day, in the intervening years. 

But, Facebook has been a bad actor when it comes to using data and protecting peoples' rights. Some of these issues are listed in [my blog post](https://www.amelia.mn/blog/misc/2019/12/29/Deleting-Facebook.html), although Facebook has just continued to do bad things:

- [Facebook’s own civil rights auditors say its policy decisions are a ‘tremendous setback’](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/08/facebook-civil-rights-audit/)
- [Facebook Engages in Online Segregation and Redlining Through Discriminatory Advertising System, Lawyers’ Committee Argues](https://lawyerscommittee.org/lawyers-committee-confronts-facebooks-attempts-to-dismiss-digital-redlining-lawsuit-against-its-housing-advertisements/)

# Getting data from Facebook

Facebook actually makes it pretty easy to get a lot of your data. You can choose `.json` or `.html` formats. I ended up grabbing both, but I think the `.html` is probably easiest for most folks (it's what your dad would understand). 

.pull-left[
- photos and videos
- friends
- messages
- security and login information
- other activity
- profile information
- posts
- ads
- about you
- following and followers
]
.pull-right[
- groups
- events
- comments
- search history
- likes and reactions
- location
- pages
- your places
- files

In the nine months since I deleted my account, I have definitely reached into this data a fair amount. It has helped me verify dates of things that happened, remember jokes between my friends and I, etc.

# Data Facebook does not give you

There were two notable things I wanted from my data that don't come from the data download:

- tagged photos
- friends' birthdays

There are python scripts out there to help you get each of those things. I was able to make the script for grabbing birthdays work, but none of the python scripts for tagged photos. 

So, I wrote my own scraper in R.

  mutate(filename = paste0("img/FB_download", row_number(), ".jpg"))

write_csv(srcs_df, "fb_images.csv")
```

**Closing down RSelenium**. (This code should work, but never completely does for me. I always have to go into Activity Monitor on my Mac and kill the java process.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remDr$close()
```

**Actually... downloading the photos** 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(curl)
srcs_df <- read_csv("fb_images.csv")
for (i in 1:3) {
  curl_download(srcs_df$url[i], srcs_df$filename[i])
}
```

???

I'm pretty sure this could have been vectorized or made into a map statement.

# Iterating

This code is extremely hacky, and full of `for` loops! I thought I would refactor it before this talk, but I did not. Maybe that's an exercise for you? (Keeping in mind what [GeePaw Hill says](https://www.geepawhill.org/2019/03/03/refactoring-pro-tip-easiest-nearest-owwie-first/))

If you want to see my previous failed attempts, check out the (now-removed) file [UselessScraps.md](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/deleting_facebook/blob/27914dc33d9ecacc4f68c24fbdddcdd16dd70b23/UselessScraps.md) on my GitHub repo. I tried `rvest`, more complicated `RSelenium` things, and `splashr`, to no avail.
